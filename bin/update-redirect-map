"""maintains an add/append-only list of known content paths in a yaml file, with optional redirects when moved or deleted

Currently, only markdown (.md) content is tracked

The yaml file looks like this:

```
# When a file is first found, the value is set to None
an-existing/path.md: None

# If a key with value None is missing, a warning will be emitted
a-previously-existing/path.md: null
â‡’ "Not found: a-previously-existing/path.md no longer exists"

# If no one cares about that path, it can be commented out (or removed)
# an-old-irrelevant/path.md was deleted and will not be redirected 
#an-old-irrelevant/path.md: null

# Or, if a redirect is desired, it may be added manually
# an-old-redirected/path.md was updated to new/path.md and will be redirected
an-old-redirected/path.md: new/path.md
```
