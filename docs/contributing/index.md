# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the biocommons! We welcome your participation!

biocommons projects use shared technical standards and coding guidelines in order to operate
consistently and coherently, and to facilitate contributors moving between projects.



## Getting Started

New to Biocommons and looking for ways to contribute? The best way to get started is to sign up on
the [Biocommons Slack](getting-connected.md#slack) and introduce yourself in the #intros channel! You should
also join one or more [Biocommons discussion lists](getting-connected.md#discussion-lists).

If you have a specific feature in mind for a Biocommons product, create an issue following our
[coding guidelines](coding-guidelines.md#issues) to get in touch with a project team.

## Preferred Tools

- Meetings: Google Calendar and Google Meet, with an agenda attached to the meeting
- Google Groups for mailing lists
- Source code and planning: GitHub, with GitHub issues and projects
- Documentation: markdown, with diagrams in mermaid and diagrams.net (aka drawio), in code repo.
- Development: VS Code, with recommended setup for embedded mermaid and drawings.net support

## Ways to Contribute

- Write code
- Triage issues and help users on mailing lists
- Clarify features to be developed
- Write and edit documentation
- Update and release SeqRepo and UTA
- Help with community projects, like the [upcoming hackathon](hackathon-2023.md)
