# Getting Started

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the biocommons community! Contributions are welcome
and greatly appreciated.  There are many types of contributions and you don't need to be a
developer!

Your first step should be to connect to the community by joining
the [Biocommons Slack](getting-connected.md#slack) and introducing yourself in the #intros channel! You should
also join one or more [Biocommons discussion lists](../community/getting-connected.md#groups).

## Ways to Contribute

### Write code: fix bugs and implement features

Obviously, our reason for being here is to write high-quality bioinformatics tools.  If you want to
write code, please read our [Coding Guidelines](./coding-guidelines.md) first.  Not ready to
contribute code? No problem -- keep reading!

### Report bugs

See something that doesn't work the way you expect?  Ask about it on slack or a mailing list.  And,
if you think it's a bug, report it in the project's issue tracker; see the [Projects
page](../projects.md) for links.

### Foster a strong community: Triage issues, refine features, plan hackathons

One of the most valuable places people can contribute is to respond to issues on GitHub and mailing
lists.  You might ask people to clarify a problem, suggest initial remedies, or work with a group of
users on refining a feature request.  Responding to issues often falls to developers, so having your
help with triaging issues directly adds to the time that developers can spend fixing bugs and
implementing features.  Being a bridge between the community and developers great way for you to
learn how the tools work if you want to ease into becoming a contributor.

We also have periodic [hackathons](../hackathons), which are fun and work to plan.

### Write and maintaining documentation

Writing and maintaining good documentation is hard!  As with triaging issues and features, this task
often falls to developers, your help creates space for keeping the project moving forward and is a
great way to learn.

### Help with SeqRepo and UTA releases

The biocommons maintains SeqRepo and UTA snapshots.  These require experience with the code as well
as experience with data processing automation and quality control.  If you'd like to help, get in touch!




### Contribute your superpower!

Do you have other superpowers to lend? Graphics? Project management? Developer experience? Writing?
Something else?  Great!  Get in touch and let us know how you'd like to contribute.

If you have a specific feature in mind for a Biocommons product, create an issue following our
[coding guidelines](coding-guidelines.md#issues) to get in touch with a project team.

Hi! We're glad that you're thinking about joining the community of contributors.  There's a lot to
do and many ways to contribute to the biocommons!
