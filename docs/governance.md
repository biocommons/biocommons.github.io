# Governance

**This governance document provides a framework for the organization, decision making, and essential
values of the biocommons community. The Steering Committee (defined below) will refine and maintain
this document in order to serve the objectives of the biocommons community.**

## Mission

The goal of the biocommons community is to accelerate research, promote data sharing, and improve
human health by collaborating on interoperable, high-quality, bioinformatics software and data for
sequence variant interpretation, and to foster a community that develops these tools.

## Values and Norms

The biocommons community is founded on shared [values](/community/#values) and
[norms](/community/#norms). We use minimal organizational structures necessary to promote the
mission.

## Membership

Members of the biocommons are individuals who 1) actively contribute to the overall community and 2)
uphold our [contribution guidelines](/contributing/) (including [our code of
conduct](/code-of-conduct/)). Contributions include activities that further the mission, such as
writing documentation, providing technical assistance in forums, triaging issues, managing projects,
providing logistics support, and, of course, coding.

Members who violate biocommons our code of conduct may be suspended from participation in the
biocommons, including leadership positions.

biocommons membership applies to individuals; there is no mechanism for membership by institutions
or organizations.

## Organizational Needs and Teams

The biocommons organization has the following structure:

- The **Executive Director** oversees the Steering Committee and is generally responsible for
  overall biocommons operations.
- The **Steering Committee** provides general administrative oversight for the biocommons community.
- The **Project Teams** plan and coordinate development activities within their projects,
  consistent with biocommons architectural directions.

### Executive Director

Reece Hart is the initial Executive Director.  The Steering Committee will help define this role and
the mechanism and frequency for selecting subsequent Executive Directors.

### Steering Committee

The Steering Committee is comprised of the Executive Director and other members who are invited by
the Executive Director. Decisions in the Steering Committee are made by the Executive Director with
input from Steering Committee members. The Steering Committee is expected to meet every 3 months.

The Steering Committee:

  scientific community, and enforcing our code of conduct.
- Updates this governance document and resolves questions about its interpretation.
- Selects leaders for project teams.
- Receives and responds to issues regarding membership and breaches of community standards.

- Establishes coding guidelines and standards in order maximize the utility of biocommons software
  and data.

- Arranges technical and systems administration support, such as AWS infrastructure and web site
  development.

### Project Teams

Project Teams are responsible for planning and coordinating development activities within their
projects. A project typically corresponds to one or more related source code repositories.

Project Teams should have at least two Project Leads, appointed by the Steering Committee. The
Project Leaders are the primary maintainers of the relevant repositories. Project Leaders are
nominated by the Steering Committee based on recognized domain expertise and sustained contribution
to the biocommons.  Project Leaders are expected to ensure that project repositories are managed
consistent with the overall biocommons [contribution guidelines](/contributing/).

### Other Teams and Roles

The Steering Committee may identify and create additional roles and teams as needed, such as project
management, documentation, testing, technical support, logistics, AWS infrastructure management,
GitHub account management, and web site support.
