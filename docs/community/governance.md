# Governance

**This governance document provides a framework for the organization, decision making, and essential
values of the biocommons community. The Steering Committee (defined below) will refine and maintain
this document in order to serve the objectives of the biocommons community.**

## Mission

The goal of the biocommons community is to accelerate research, promote data sharing, and improve
human health by collaborating on interoperable, high-quality, bioinformatics software and data for
sequence variant interpretation, and to foster a community that develops these tools.

## Membership

Members of the biocommons are individuals who 1) actively contribute to the overall community and 2)
uphold our [contribution guidelines](../contributing/index.md), [our code of conduct](../community/code-of-conduct.md), and
[values and norms](../community/index.md). Contributions include activities that further the mission, such as
writing documentation, providing technical assistance in forums, triaging issues, managing projects,
providing logistics support, and, of course, coding.
