# Hackathon 2023

We are having an in-person hackathon on September 17-18, 2023 at [Mindspace San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mindspace+San+Francisco/data=!4m2!3m1!19sChIJ1SY5AOOBhYARpyx2-yXz53M). The goal of the hackathon is to have new and existing collaborators develop and advance biocommons projects.

## Attendance is Invitation-Only

**The hackathon is in-person and open by invitation only** due to space and funding constraints. Factors for invitation are:

- Prior engagement with biocommons
- Commitment to the biocommons mission
- Commitment to active engagement, focus, and contributions during the hackathon (i.e., no observers, no side projects)
- Commitment to making future contributions
- Commitment to our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct)
- Diversity of institutions, opinions, ideas, and social factors
- Uninterrupted attendance both days

If you wish to attend but have not been invited, please introduce yourself on #hackathon-2023 (see
below). You will be added to a wait list for consideration as we get closer to the event.

## Invitation to students

We will be inviting 1-3 high school, college, or graduate students to participate. We are
particularly interested in opening opportunities for people who might not otherwise be exposed to
bioinformatics and scientific collaboration. There are no skills criteria to participate.  If you're
interested, please introduce yourself on the Slack hackathon-2023 channel (see below).

## Projects

Projects are still being vetted and should be announced in July.  When ready, they will appear
at the [hackathon-2023 repo](https://github.com/biocommons/hackathon-2023).

## Staying connected

Planning for the hackathon, and announcements during it, will be on the [#hackathon-2023](https://app.slack.com/client/TDL15ES3T/C05FPBLML1Y) slack channel.  See [Community](/community/) for how to join.
