# Hackathon 2023

We are having an in-person hackathon on September 17-18, 2023 at [Mindspace San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mindspace+San+Francisco/data=!4m2!3m1!19sChIJ1SY5AOOBhYARpyx2-yXz53M). The goal of the hackathon is to have new and existing collaborators develop and advance Biocommons projects.

## Attendance is Invitation-Only

**The hackathon is in-person and open by invitation only** due to space and funding constraints. Factors for invitation are:

- Prior engagement with biocommons
- Commitment to biocommons mission
- Commitment to making future contributions
- Diversity of institutions, opinions, ideas, and social factors
- Uninterrupted attendance both days

If you wish to attend but have not been invited, please introduce yourself on #hackathon-2023 (see
below). You will be added to a wait list for consideration as we get closer to the event.

## Projects

Projects are still being vetted and should be announced in late June.  When ready, they will appear
at the [hackathon-2023 repo](https://github.com/biocommons/hackathon-2023).

## Staying connected

Planning for the hackathon, and announcements during it, will be on the [#hackathon-planning](https://app.slack.com/client/TDL15ES3T/C055VVAR77Y) slack channel.  See [Community](/community/) for how to join.
