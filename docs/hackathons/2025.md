## Projects

We are accepting project proposals. To propose a project, please submit your idea using
our [GitHub issue template](https://github.com/biocommons/hackathon/issues/new?template=hackathon-proposal.yml).
We encourage you to submit your proposal ASAP so others have a time to review your
proposal before the event.

Check out the [repository proposal tracker](https://github.com/biocommons/hackathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22hackathon%202025%22)
and express your interest in proposed hackathon projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

## Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have a few minutes at the start of the hackathon to give a brief pitch.
After the pitches, we will break off into smaller groups to focus on the proposals that
generate the most interest and engagement.

## Agenda

We will have a more detailed agenda closer to the event.

## Staying connected

Planning for the hackathon, and announcements during it, will be on the #hackathon-2025
slack channel.  See [Community](../community/getting-connected.md) for how to join.
