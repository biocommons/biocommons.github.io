# Welcome to the biocommons!

<img width="15%" src="images/logo.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 50px;">

*The biocommons project is a community of diagnostic testing labs and academic
groups that fosters pre-competitive collaboration on interoperable and
high-quality bioinformatics software and data, primarily  for sequence variant
interpretation.*

## Projects

- [anyvar](https://github.com/biocommons/anyvar)
  [in development] Proof-of-Concept variation translation, validation, and registration service
- [bioutils](https://github.com/biocommons/bioutils)
  provides common tools and lookup tables used primarily by the hgvs and uta packages
- [eutils](https://github.com/biocommons/eutils) simplified searching, fetching, and parsing records
  from NCBI using their E-utilities interface
- [hgvs](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs)
  Python library to parse, format, validate, normalize, and map sequence variants.
- [SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo)
  non-redundant, compressed, journalled, file-based storage for biological sequences
- [seqreo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service)
  OpenAPI-based REST interface to biological sequences and sequence metadata
- [UTA](https://github.com/biocommons/uta)
  Universal Transcript Archive: comprehensive genome-transcript
  alignments; multiple transcript sources, versions, and alignment
  methods; available as a docker image
- [uta-align](https://github.com/biocommons/uta-align)
  C-based Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman alignment algorithms with a Python interface.
