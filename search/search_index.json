Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Examples of unacceptable behavior include: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Enforcement Responsibilities Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. Scope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Correction Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

Members who violate biocommons values or the code of conduct may be suspended from participation in the biocommons, including leadership positions. The biocommons does not currently provide a mechanism for institutional or organization membership. Organizational Needs and Teams The biocommons has the following structure: The Steering Committee provides general administrative oversight for the biocommons project. The Architecture Team sets coding guidelines and standards in order maximize the utility of biocommons software and data. The Project Teams plan and coordinate development activities within their projects, consistent with biocommons architectural directions. The Operations Team provides technical and systems administration support, such as AWS infrastructure and web site development.

Steering Committee The Steering Committee: Is resposible for the development of a healthy organization. Updates this governance document and resolves questions about its interpretation. Selects leaders for other teams. Receives and responds to issues regarding membership and breaches of community standards. The Steering Committee is comprised of the Executive Director and other members who are invited by the Executive Director. The Steering Committee is expected to meet every 3 months. Decisions in the Steering Committee are made by the Executive Director with input from Steering Committee members. Architecture Team The Architecture Team: Is comprised of the Architecture Lead and other members who are appointed by the Steering Committee. Makes project-wide techincal decisions in order to foster consisitency and interoperability. Establishes coding guidelines. Participates in project code reviews as requested. It is expected that Project Leads (below) should attend Architectural Team meetings in order to raise issues or concerns, and to ensure that projects remain aligned and coordinated. Decisions in the Architecture Team are expected to be made by consensus. The Executive Director is a member of the Architecture Team and may override decisions in exceptional circumstances. Project Teams Project Teams are responsible for planning and coordinating development activities within their projects. A project typically corresponds to one or more related source code repositories. Project Teams should have at least two Project Leads, appointed by the Steering Committee. The Project Leads are the primary maintainers of the relevant repositories. Management of project repositories should be consistent with the overall biocommons coding guidelines . Team Leadership Team leaders are nominated by the Steering Committee based on recognized domain expertise and sustained contribution to the biocommons. Other Teams and Roles The Steering Committee may identify and create additional roles and teams as needed, such as project management, documentation, testing, technical support, logistics, AWS infrastructure management, GitHub account management, and web site support.
